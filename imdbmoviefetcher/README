Version 5 change log : 

Contributed by : Zarko

1. As I had problems with google rejecting searches from the script after a while, I added support for duckduckgo. The script actually detects this and switches to duckduckgo automatically

2. I also needed original movie title (if not in english), so I added parsing for that too

3. Added a movie year as an optional argument, it gives much better results when the movie name isn't unique through the years

4. Also added the parameters to enter imdb ID directly and to select google or duckduckgo

5. Fixed GENRE searching, as it gave me blank results
